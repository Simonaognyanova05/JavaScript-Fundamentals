# JavaScript Fundamentals, SoftUni
This is the first web course I've taken on Softuni.

The course includes handling of standard software functionality, working with linear data structures, understanding the interrelationship between different IT concepts, problem analysis and reduction to computer-executable steps, and basic HTML and CSS skills.
